For the code quality, I sometimes use the methods within the larger ones. This technique makes the code more succinct rather than tedious. 
Another technique that I use to maintain code quality is to use the created methods to simplify the code. Due to the usage of created methods, the code
composition of the paint program is very readable and understandable to the reader. The most frequently-used technique that I use for organization would
be how I use a space between two chunks of code to make the code more appealing and to differentiate where I transition into coding one feature to another.
